# Let's Split HS


This is a split 40% ortho board. It is the exact same footprint and the Let's Split keyboard by wootpatoot. This board has USB-C / RGB Underglow / and is all on-board. Meant as a drop-in replacement for the V2 Let's Split.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make lets_split_eh/eh:default

See [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) then the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information.
